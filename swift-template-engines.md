# Swift
Template engines written in Swift:

## [Stencil](https://github.com/stencilproject/Stencil)
Stencil is a simple template language in swift. It provides a syntax similar to Django and Mustache. [Documentation](https://stencil.fuller.li/en/latest/templates.html)

## [GRMustache.swift](https://github.com/groue/GRMustache.swift)
GRMustache extends the Mustache language with built-in functions and extensibility hooks that let you avoid the strict minimalism of Mustache when you need it.
